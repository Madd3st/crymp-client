# Agent handoff — WarsBots for CryMP (multi-bot checkpoint, 2026-10-23)

Branch under review: `warsbots/feature/multibot` (fork `Madd3st/crymp-client`).
Base: `warsbots/feature/ia-participants` WIP `6718af16` → `6a8c241c` (C2660 fix) → multi-bot series.
`warsbots/main` (`caf1a815`) is untouched; nothing here is merged. Upstream is never pushed.

Read with this file: [STATUS](STATUS.md) (evidence log), [AI_TESTS](AI_TESTS.md) (how to run),
[MULTIBOT_DESIGN](MULTIBOT_DESIGN.md), [ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW](ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md),
[COMBAT_REFERENCE](COMBAT_REFERENCE.md), [AI_LEARNING_FEASIBILITY](AI_LEARNING_FEASIBILITY.md).

## 1. Verification vocabulary (what PASS means here)

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| BUILD PASS | MSVC 19.44 x64 Release, Ninja, `Tools/Build-WarsBots.ps1` on the owner's PC, zero errors |
| SERVER-LOG PASS | headless loopback IA server (port 64120, **no client**) log shows the event chain; parsed by `Tools/wb_log_report.py` |
| CLIENT/VISUAL | a real client watched it — **none yet for this branch** |
| USER | owner confirmed in play — **none yet for this branch** |

A SERVER-LOG PASS proves server simulation, native damage/kill/score paths and lifecycle.
It does not prove replication to clients, animation, or "plays well".

## 2. Milestones

| | What | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | build ON + OFF | **BUILD PASS** at `ce36de5b`; ON re-built at `8e26fb32`, `49f2bae2`, `7572a4f5` | runner `build-on: PASS` |
| M2 | one bot = old behaviour | not re-run in isolation; covered by M3 (same code path, Universal/Normal = caf1a815 constants) | — |
| M3 | 2 bots, no human, fight | **SERVER-LOG PASS** twice (`49f2bae2`, `7572a4f5`) | see §5 |
| M4 | 6 bots | **SERVER-LOG PASS** (`7572a4f5`, partial 240/300 s read) | STATUS "M3b and M4" |
| M5 | remove/re-add/map change | partial: native IA reset → remove → restore PASS; `wb_remove`/`wb_remove_all` mid-match NOT RUN | — |
| M6 | human + bots, 2 clients | NOT RUN on this branch | needs owner |

```

### BotManager (replaces BotSpawner, deleted)
- `Owns(id)` / `Find(id)` / `AIEnabled(id)` are the only questions engine hooks ask.
- During `BotInstance::Spawn` the instance is exposed through `m_spawning` so `BotMatch::Register`
  and `CPlayer::Init` (`IsCreatingActor(name)`) recognise it before it is in the map.
- `OnPostUpdate`: restore pending roster → update every bot in number order → `Sweep()` expired.
- `ENTITY_EVENT_DONE` never erases (it can fire inside our own `RemoveEntity`). If the entity was
  **not** removed by us (`BotInstance::Removing()==false`) and the level is live, the bot is added
  to a roster and re-created next frame with the same number/profile — see §6 "IA restart".
- `eAE_resetBegin` also snapshots the roster; level end / disconnect clear everything.
- `ChooseSpawnLocation(self, avoid)`: native `IsSpawnLocationSafe` (other Player bodies, bots
  included) + `TestSpawnLocationWithEnvironment`, per-bot salted start index.
- Commands: `wb_add [n] [skill] [style]`, `wb_remove <number>`, `wb_remove_all`, `wb_list`,
  `wb_status`, `wb_debug 0|1`, `wb_select <number>`; cvars `wb_maxbots` (6, hard 16), `wb_skill`,
  `wb_probe_local_test` (gate, 0), `wb_bot_cloak_experimental` (0). Legacy `wb_bot_*`/`wb_probe_*`
  act on the selected bot.

### BotInstance
Holds EntityId + `const IEntity*` identity guard (compared, never dereferenced). `Revive` uses the
shared spawn chooser and native `CGameRules::RevivePlayer`. Profiling: wall ms per Update.

### Targeting (BotTargeting)
Old `Enemy()` required `GetChannelId()!=0` + live `INetChannel` → bots could never target bots.
Now: Human = Player with a live server channel; Bot = owned by the registry; then self / spectator /
dead / hidden-or-in-vehicle are excluded; same non-zero `CGameRules::GetTeam` → Ally; else Enemy.
IA has team 0 → free-for-all. Perception unchanged: 80 m, LOS rays eyes→chest and eyes→eyes, muzzle
ray before firing; no wallhack.

### Brain changes
Per-bot `Configure(profile, number)`: golden-ratio phase for aim noise, staggered 10 Hz decision tick,
strafe side/period offsets, patrol order. Ranges, reaction, aim error, burst/gap from BotProfile.
`SEARCHING_ENEMY` roams between IA spawn points (public map knowledge) instead of 6–10 m local legs;
1.5 s blocked → one local detour leg. Falling faster than 3 m/s → Defense (Armor) even in freefall;
moving Strength jumps also probe the far touchdown (5.5 m, refuse drops > 2.5 m).

### GameRules / ShotValidator / Player / serialization
Only call-site changes: `GetSpawner().Owns(...)` → `GetBotManager().Owns(...)`, `TraceHit/TraceKill`
through the manager, `IsOwnedProjectileHit` through the manager. Network serialization
(`WarsBotMotion`, `WarsBotSuitActive` optional groups, `warsBotActor` spawn info) is **unchanged**;
`CPlayer::Init` marks a bot by `IsCreatingActor(entityName)` instead of the fixed name `WarsBot_01`.
GameRules participant APIs from the IA WIP (`IsMatchParticipant`, `GetMatchParticipants`,
`GetMatchParticipantCount`, `IsPlayerInGame`) are unchanged.

### IA integration (from WIP, fixed)
`BotMatch::Register`: `Script::CallMethod(hooks, "Attach", rules)` and
`Script::CallMethod(rules, "ResetScore", id)` (was nonexistent `Script::Call` overload → C2660).
Flag `warsBotParticipant` is set only after ResetScore succeeds.

## 4. Invariants (do not break)
No fake INetChannel / OnClientConnect(0); global `IsPlayer()` unchanged; ShotValidator accepts only
an owned bot's real non-remote projectile of its own weapon; no teleport, no direct HP writes, no
infinite energy; experimental CMake OFF by default; runtime gate 0; loopback LAN InstantAction only.

## 5. Evidence

M3 `49f2bae2` (`WarsBots-Claude-m3-173247.log`, 240 s): 2 bots; native IA RestartGame removed both,
2/2 restored (new EntityIds); REAL PICKUP of map weapons after reset; 8 acquisitions `kind=bot`;
9 bot→bot hits; WarsBot_02 killed WarsBot_01 (4×31) via stock KillPlayer; IA SCORE shooter 1/0,
victim deaths +1; revives 2/2 same EntityId; avg ≈0.03 ms/frame; no crash. 3 fall self-hits (fixed next).
M3b `7572a4f5` (`m3b-174130`, 240 s): restored 2/2; 8 bot→bot hits; 1 bot→bot kill, scores 1/0 and 0/1;
**0 self-damage**; no crash.
M4 `7572a4f5` (`m4-174530`): 6 bots, 6/6 restored after IA restart, 24 bot→bot acquisitions,
61 bot→bot hits, 4 kills by three different bots, 4/4 revives, 0.077 ms/frame for all six, no crash.

Performance: per-bot update ≈0.01–0.02 ms average, worst frame ≤1–2 ms (first frames, item spawn);
≤350 rays per 10 s report for 2 bots. Not yet compared with a bot-free baseline frame time.

## 6. Known bugs / limits
- **IA restart**: bots count as participants, so PreGame start timer fires and native RestartGame
  deletes runtime actors via `GameFramework::Reset` without `eAE_resetBegin`. We re-create them
  (new EntityIds, scores reset by the native restart). Works; but it is detection-by-side-effect.
  Better: hook the IA `RestartGame`/`OnResetEntities` path explicitly.
- Each commit changes `version.h` (git describe) → most of CryGame rebuilds (~2–3 min).
- No pathfinding: straight lines + local avoidance; enclosed spots still block.
- Headshot: incoming 26 → health −1067 in an old run; hypothesis in ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW, unverified.
- Not observed on this branch: client view of N bots, Tab rendering, bot vs human, two clients,
  `wb_remove` mid-match, map change, team modes, Power Struggle.
- Cloak OFF by default. Test SCAR fallback still used before map pickups exist (pre-reset phase).

## 7. Refactoring recommendations
1. Replace reset detection with an explicit IA hook (Lua wrapper `RestartGame` → C++ notify).
2. Split BotBrain (≈420 lines) into decision (FSM) and tactics (range/strafe/suit) modules.
3. Target scans: O(N²); time-slice when N>8 after a baseline measurement.
4. Move test-ability commands out of BotBrain into a debug controller.
5. Navigation provider interface (CryAI if nav data exists on IA maps, else waypoint graph).

## 8. QA automation
`Tools/ClaudeQA/*` (copy into `<checkout>\ClaudeQA\`, write `game-dir.txt` with the Crysis root):
runner polls `inbox\*.json` → fresh `Claude-Job.ps1` per job (build on|both, qa runs, push) →
`outbox\<id>.json` with HEAD. Separate worktree `..\crymp-multibot`; never touches game-root EXEs or
the owner's port-64110 session. `Tools/wb_log_report.py <log>` → summary + M3 verdict.

## 9. Next task
Tactical combat quality on 6 bots (target switching, damage reaction, cover/height, suit use) with
M4 as the regression gate; then owner playtest against bots (instructions in AI_TESTS "Owner test").
