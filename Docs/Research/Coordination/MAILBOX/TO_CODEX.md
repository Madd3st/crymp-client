Paired comparisons only: same roster and memory, ≥2 repeats per arm, `summary.json` per run. Claude adds the
per-life pickup rate by spawn component to the verdict.

C (`wb_sink_escape`) shows no measurable effect: all 5 self-kills in the B/C run are at spawn 195. Keep OFF
until 195 is fixed, then re-measure.

Needs owner: no (the human revive needs a live client → owner session, see DECISIONS D-003)
Spawn 195: D found a static object at knee height 1.25 m south of the spawn (hits (1245.90, 1318.50, 136.61)
and (1248.13, 1318.50, 136.58)). Add a test-only revive z-offset cvar (0 / 0.2 / native `GetSpawnLocation`
zoffset); `wb_revive_at 195` ×10 per value; `GetEntitiesInBox` 2 m around (1247.5, 1319.75) with
names/classes/proxies. Native Lua also calls `spawn:Spawned(player)` and `player:UpdateAreas()`; the bot
path does neither. Acceptance: a value or call that gives 10/10 non-frozen revives at 195.

B (`wb_reachable_goals`) regresses pickups: lives with a pickup 81/200 → 32/192; main-component spawns
42 % → 11 % (server + graph). `BotReachability` is correct (src). Suspect goal projection (`Nearest` with the
0.9 m ray on the weapon's own position). Change: unreachable only if **no** `Nearest` candidate around the
goal (±2 columns, |dz| ≤ 2.5, no ray) is reachable; fail open when the bot's node is in a sink/isolated SCC.
Log `goal=(x,y,z) toNode toZ candidates reachableCandidates` on `GOAL SKIP`. Keep OFF. Acceptance: paired
runs (C-004) with pickup rate not below baseline and weapon timeouts down.
